Read the standart input
	1. read n maps/files
	2. read a string/s and transform it into a map

Open and read
	Open file;
	Read open map
		Read the first line - store for variables; ?global variable? + line lenght
		Read the second line - get how long is it
		Read the whole map and put it in a array 2D
		Check the map for map errors

Solve
** what we need - struct solution - with x, y, size; 
	start loop
	move starting point to a new place or/ start form a[0][0]
							//optimisation idea - end the loop for going into n - The_biggest_size_solution_we_have_found_now
		start loop
			check if valind / if inside of map
			we store the current solution
			we expand +1 in x and y;
		end loop with the biggest solution for this position       *store in x,y,size
	store the solution if is the biggest so far
	end loop




Print it

Continue to the next map
